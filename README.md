# Demo: Music bot with spotify
This demo uses the experimental Web Speech API, which is currently only [supported](http://caniuse.com/#search=speech) by Blink-based browsers including Chrome 25+, Opera 27+, Samsung Internet, QQ Browser, and Baidu Browser.

This is how this web app works:

1. Using the Web Speech APIâ€™s `SpeechRecognition` interface to listen your voice from a microphone
2. Send your message to [API.ai](https://api.ai) (the natural language processing platform) as a text string
3. Once the AI from the API.ai returns the reply text back, use the `SpeechSynthesis` interface to give it a synthetic voice. Now it changes name to Dialogflow mainrained by Google https://console.dialogflow.com

## Installation
1. Need Node.js
2. MongoDB for database npm install mongodb
3. in root run node index.js

## Instruction
